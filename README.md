## Building Todoist from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library

This application (a Todoist clone) was built using create-react-app as a base, and the technologies used were React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library. I'm hoping this gives people a better understanding of React, and I've also included SCSS in this tutorial, but the main focus is to build a real application using React! If you clone this application, click the Pizza icon on the top right, it enables dark mode!
